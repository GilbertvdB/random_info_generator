# random_info_generator

<h2> Random information generator</h2>

</br>The following app was created to generate random info so I could populate tables in databases.
It generates random info such as: 
- random name (chooses 50/50 between male or female names.)
- randon male name (top 100 names from around 1930)
- random female name (top 100 names from around 1930)
- random lastname (dutch lastnames)
- dutch street adress and number
- dutch postal codes
- ducth phone numbers

</br> I want to add 105 people to the tables and in order to simulate persons with the same name I've created a new file with 75 randomly picked names.
